#### Work Experience
In my exploration of the industry, I have been driven by the desire to understand how various technologies are implemented and operate in real-world scenarios. By engaging in multiple roles, I have bridged the gap between academic theory and practical application:

- **Tencent**: I participated in the development of core modules for a network acceleration system, witnessing firsthand how theoretical concepts translate into tangible performance improvements. This experience provided me with a deeper understanding of the practical challenges and solutions in high-performance networking.
- **Huawei Singapore Research Institute**: As a research intern, I led projects on blockchain consensus algorithm optimization and network security. This role allowed me to see how cutting-edge research can address real-world security challenges, enhancing my appreciation for the intersection of academia and industry.
- **Meituan**: Serving as a backend development intern, I focused on distributed systems and high-concurrency architecture. This position gave me insights into the complexities of scaling systems and managing data in a fast-paced environment.

These experiences have not only broadened my technical horizons but also highlighted the importance of foundational research in driving industrial innovation. They have solidified my determination to pursue a Ph.D., where I aim to further explore the integration of networks, system  and AI, addressing the technical bottlenecks that I have observed in both academic and industrial contexts.

Throughout my career, I have actively engaged in various industrial roles to gain a broad understanding of real-world challenges and identify my interests. I have worked as a Software Engineer Intern at Meituan.com, focusing on traditional backend development, and explored cybersecurity and blockchain technology as a Research Intern at Huawei Singapore Research Center. Most recently, I have contributed to network acceleration systems at Tencent Inc. These experiences have allowed me to explore different aspects of technology and work modes, ultimately leading me to decide to pursue a Ph.D. to delve deeper into my interests.
